### Rank arbitrary lists through human-powered comparison sorting

Ranking lists of choices according to our preference can be difficult. The exact order encoded implicitly in our mind often eludes our consciousness. By contrast, we can typically tell immediately which of **two** choices we prefer.

humergesort uses the [merge sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort) algorithm with *you* as the "comparison function" to provide you with an exact ranking of your choices by asking you a series of simple "versus" questions.
